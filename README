This project requires jQuery and the jQuery SVG plugin, which can be downloaded from here:
http://docs.jquery.com/Downloading_jQuery (we've used 1.7.2)
http://keith-wood.name/svg.html


And in a future version, we would build it both for JQuery SVG and Raphael, we would love some help implementing this. About choosing which to build for, we refer to this thread (for now):
